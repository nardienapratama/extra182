Welcome, Visitor! :]

This is my extra182 blog for Operating Systems.

I am going to be learning about how to use Github and also implement Jekyll with it.

I will be writing daily logs starting from today onwards during this project.





Hopefully, all goes well in this project. 
Thanks for visiting :)
