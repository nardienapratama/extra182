Today, I have git pulled the UI-FASILKOM-OS/extra182 repository, since my teammate had already modified the theme a while ago.

I then made one of the tutorials for the website, which is the one on Ruby and Jekyll installation. I have already made sure that the layout of the page is according to the theme (using the default layout).
