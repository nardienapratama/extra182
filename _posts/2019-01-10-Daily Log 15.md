So since I couldn't find a way to make the navigation bar appear on github io, I decided to just use a theme that already has a navbar by default (adding a navbar manually can only appear on localhost).

I changed the theme in my 'test' repo to leap-day, and tried changing the links on the navbar too. So, I am going to change the theme in my 'extra182' to one that has a navbar by default later (unless I choose to not have a navbar at all).

Also, since the extra182 group repo's index.md has been modified by my teammate, I have also fixed the link to the tutorial for installing jekyll and ruby in the repo.
