Today, the task was to install git on my computer, but since I had already installed it a while ago, I didn't need to do this.

I also already know how to use git commands, such as git push, git pull, and git clone.

I also learned more about Jekyll from watching some videos about it. Jekyll is used to help make webpages we make on our GitHub repos look better. With Jekyll, we don't need to make HTML or CSS files and we can use Markdown instead, which would auto-generate the HTML and CSS files for you.

Since I had installed Jekyll the other day, I created a new Jekyll site. Unfortunately, I encountered some errors when trying to run the Jekyll site. And when I tried to 'bundle install', it also caused some errors.

I tried re-installing the Ruby + Devkit on my computer, but the error still occurred. I tried fixing it but it still didn't work.

I had actually tried this yesterday and it worked - I could load the site at https://localhost:4000 but for some reason, it hasn't been working today.
