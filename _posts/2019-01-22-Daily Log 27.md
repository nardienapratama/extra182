# Daily Log 27
-----

Today, I have tried my best so that this site and the group site can be as related as possible.

I've made links to both the author's page as well as the daily logs. I have fixed all of my logs' layout settings (including the permalinks and the layout template chosen) and added a title for each.

 I have also used the {{page.title}}-type notation in my index.md, however, couldn't do the same for the daily logs, as there seems to be a conflict with the 'title' specified in the index.md so I opted to use the usual "#" notation.

 I have also changed the title and descriptions in the website so that it does not refer to the extra182 assigment, rather just to the GitHub+Jekyll learning aspect of it. I have also added all the tutorials in this website.
