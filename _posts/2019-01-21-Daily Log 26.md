Made finishing touches and some other stuff.

I fixed the 'about us' page today and made sure that the content is more inviting to read.

<!-- I also realized that for some reason, my 'posts' folder in my directory in the Sandbox folder was missing - it may have accidentally gotten deleted yesterday after the last time I pushed since it was working then - so I copied all my posts from my personal repo to the group repo again. -->
