Today, I've tried to remake the nav.html file and not use Bootstrap, and just use normal html and css usage (from W3Schools).
However, the navigation bar still only shows up on localhost and not on https://nardienapratama.github.io/test/.
Unfortunately, I still haven't found a solution to this. After reading about it, turns out that some people have also encountered this problem, though the solution is still rather unclear.
