Today, I have fixed the 'Ruby and Jekyll Installation' tutorial.

I made it more detailed and clear than before, using more images and making sure that these images are clear and big enough.

I have also added all of the daily logs I've made to the extra182 group repo, making a 'posts' folder in my directory in the Sandbox folder.

I have also copied all the tutorials we've made to my personal extra182 repo. I have also modified the homepage of this repo and added some of the tutorials in it.
