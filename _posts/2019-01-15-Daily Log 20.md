Today, I have changed the theme of my personal extra182 site from minima to 'architect' so that it would look more attractive and less plain.

I also made sure that the tutorial template files are linked to the 'default.html' file located in the 'layouts' folder in the theme directory. I also chose this theme so that the posts would not be automatically included in the homepage - only the tutorials are.

I have also added another tutorial on the homepage of the site.

I also attempted to try making the title of the tutorial appear by adding the "{{site.title}}" notation in the 'default.html' file, and 'title: THE-TITLE' in the tutorial md file. However, it did not work yet as of now.

In the extra182 project, I added links to my daily logs in the page corresponding to my name in the 'Authors' section.
