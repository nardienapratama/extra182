Hi! So today, I have tried fixing yesterday's errors.

I reinstalled the Ruby + Devkit again, and this time I moved my entire GitHub folder filled with my GitHub repos to the D Drive.

I tried making a new Jekyll site again (as I had did last time), then I copied all of the Jekyll site's folder's contents to my test repo (repo used before doing things in the extra182 repo). Then when I tried to run the site on localhost, it still produced an error. However this time, after trying to bundle install, there were no more errors and the command worked fine.

Afterwards, I tried running the site on localhost and it worked.
