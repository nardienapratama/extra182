So today, I have successfully changed theme of my Jekyll site (on my 'test' repo).

Previously with the minima theme:

Now with the alembic theme:

Since the alembic theme is a remote theme, instead of putting 'gem "alembic-jekyll-theme"', I put 'gem "jekyll-remote-theme"' as well as some other plugins in the Gemfile and then ran 'bundle install'.

Then, I modified the config.yml file accordingly and ran the server to build and serve the site.
