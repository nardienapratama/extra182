Today, I have made another tutorial for the extra182 group site.

The tutorial is on how to change the Jekyll theme on our GitHub-Pages site. I have included screenshots from the GitHub-Pages supported themes' repositories, as well as the link to these themes. I have also linked the tutorial to the corresponding link in the extra182 group site.
