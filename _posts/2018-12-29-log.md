1. Today, the first task was to install git on my computer. However, I had already installed it beforehand, so I didn't need to do this.

2. I've also tried to use the different git commands such as git clone, git push, and git pull.

3. I've also watched videos about jekyll. Jekyll is used to help make the webpages from GitHub look better. It lets us do that without even using HTML or CSS (though you could if you prefer), instead you can use a Markdown.

4. I have installed the Ruby + Devkit on my computer, however, for some reason I still encounter errors when trying to run the 'bundle exec jekyll serve' command on the CMD.

And when I try to 'bundle install', I encounter this error:

At first, I thought there was probably an installation error that I had not noticed when I installed the Ruby + Devkit on my computer, however, after re-installing the whole package, the error still occurs.

I'm currently still trying to fix it but still no luck. 

* When I was trying this yesterday, it actually worked a couple of times - I could even load the jekyll site at https://localhost:4000 but for some reason, today it hasn't been working. I'm trying to fix this, but since it's getting late, I'll probably continue tomorrow.
