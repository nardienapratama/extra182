1. Today, the first task was to install git on my computer. However, I had already installed it beforehand, so I didn't need to do this.

2. I've also tried to use the different git commands such as git clone, git push, and git pull.

3. I've also watched videos about jekyll. Jekyll is used to help make the webpages from GitHub look better. It lets us do that without even using HTML or CSS (though you could if you prefer), instead you can use a Markdown.
