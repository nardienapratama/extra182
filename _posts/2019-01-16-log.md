So today, I found out that apparently the links to the tutorials were faulty. But I have fixed the error for this in the index.md file so now the links work.

I also kept trying to find how to use the {{site.title}} notation and the 'title: ' attribute but still have not found a way to make it appear on the site.

Will attempt again tomorrow.
