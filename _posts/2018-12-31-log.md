# Daily Log 3: 31st December 2018
-----

So today, I've successfully moved all the files in my 'test' repo to the 'extra182' repository. Turns out that when you run the server, the index.md file is the one that is read to display the homepage instead of the README.md - when I first made the 'extra182' repo, the README.md file was the one that was used as the homepage template.

Also, the URL: https://nardienapratama.github.io/extra182/ is now exactly the same as the localhost. I've also linked the daily logs (on the homepage) to their respective auto-generated html pages - the links for each of these logs are written on the index.md file (we need to put the link to the auto-generated HTML templates and not the .md files because if the latter, then it would redirect to the md file on github.com).
