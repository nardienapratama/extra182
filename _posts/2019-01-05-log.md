Hello,

Today I tried changing themes again in my 'test' repo. If you visit https://nardienapratama.github.io/test/, it now has the 'architect' theme. I also tried adding a navigation bar using Bootstrap, which worked when ran on http://localhost:4000/, but when pushed to github, the navigation bar couldn't appear on the webpage. I think it is an import error - I'll continue fixing this tomorrow.
