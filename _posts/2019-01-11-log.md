Today, I made sure that the 'Jekyll and Ruby Installation' tutorial had been linked in the homepage and also in the navigation bar (in the extra 182 group project). Also, I have made another tutorial, which is on the commands we need to run on our local system to create integrate our GitHub repository with Jekyll, and running it on our localhost. I have also linked my my repo in the 'Author' section in the navbar of our group project.
