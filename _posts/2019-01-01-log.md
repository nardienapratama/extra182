Today, I tried fixing the webppage on the URL: https://nardienapratama.github.io/extra182/ since the page title, for some reason, appears twice on top. However, I still haven't found a way to fix it.

I have also tried changing the theme of the website on my 'test' repository. However, it still hasn't worked - instead of changing into a different theme, the theme disappeared and the website was only blank white with the content text in it.
