I fixed my logs.

Since my teammate has made the 'Blogs' page for the extra182 site, I have modified my daily logs. I renamed each of them so that their names are more unique. I have also slightly modified each log so that the first sentence is shorter (as the first sentence is also used as the preview in the 'Blogs' page).

Also, I have added the 'layout' and 'author' setting for each post so that the Markdown would know which layout and author file to refer to.
