Hi! So today, I have tried fixing yesterday's errors. After re-installing again,
it turns out that when I tried putting the GitHub folder filled with my GitHub repositories
in the D drive, the 'bundle exec jekyll serve' command still produced an error,
which said that we needed to 'bundle install'. But this time, the 'bundle install'
command worked, as shown below:

Afterwards, the 'bundle exec jekyll serve' command worked.

Also, I have git already installed in my computer (as I've said yesterday but I wanted to show the screenshot here this time) and I already know how to use git commands, such as clone, push, and pull on git bash.

```
git clone
```

```
git push
```

```
git pull
```
