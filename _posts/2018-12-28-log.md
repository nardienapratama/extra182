# Daily Log 1: 28th December 2018
-----

Hello, so today I've made a repository in my GitHub for this Operating Systems extra assignment. I then cloned the repository to my desktop. Then, I changed the settings on the GitHub repo so that the site made from it would be made into a GitHub Pages site. I also made a README.md file in my repo, in which has the template of the webpage in Markdown.

Then, I made a folder for the daily logs I'll be making for this assignment. Lastly, I installed Ruby + Devkit, and also Jekyll afterwards, in my computer.
