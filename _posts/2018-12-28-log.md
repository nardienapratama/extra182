Today, I have made a new repository in my Github. 
1. I did this by clicking the 'New Repository' button on the '+' icon on the top right of the homepage.

2. I made sure the repo was public and that it was named as 'extra182'.

3. After the repo was made, I installed GitHub Desktop on my laptop (clicking on 'Set up in Desktop'). I also practiced on a different repo and tried using the git functions instead of cloning the repo using GitHub Desktop (the bottom part of the picture).

4. I then went to the settings tab in my repo, and modified the GitHub Pages settings so that a GitHub Pages site is built from my repository.

5. Then, I created a README.md file in my repo. For this project, I will be creating the webpage in Markdown (using the README.md file) instead of HTML. 

6. Afterwards, I made the "_posts" folder, in which contains the daily log for today and git commit the changes in GitHub Desktop. You can also git commit directly on github.com.

7. I also installed Jekyll (+ Ruby) on my computer.
