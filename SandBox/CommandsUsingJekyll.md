### 1. Afterwards, on the same directory, create a new Jekyll site using:
```
jekyll new NAME-OF-SITE
```
```
cd NAME-OF-SITE

### 3. Then, we want to commit these changes to our repository. Open command prompt in this directory. Then, run these commands:

```
git status
```

This will show you the changes that have been made since you last pulled from the GitHub repository. Afterwards, we add the changes we've made by running:
```
git add .
```

Then, we need to commit these changes by running:
```
git commit -m "WRITE-YOUR-MESSAGE"
```

Before we git push our changes, we need to git pull first
