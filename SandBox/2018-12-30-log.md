Hi! So today, I have tried fixing yesterday's errors. 

After re-installing again, it turns out that when I tried putting the GitHub folder filled with my GitHub repositories in the D drive.

1. So what I did was, firstly I opened Command Prompt from the Start menu. I then installed Jekyll and Bundler (I did this yesterday but had to do this again due to the re-installation) using:

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
2. Then, I checked if Jekyll had been installed properly using:

```
jekyll -v
```

3. Afterwards, on the same directory, I created a new Jekyll site using:
```
jekyll new NAME-OF-SITE
```
```
cd NAME-OF-SITE
```
4. Then, I copied all of the folders and files inside of this directory (except for the .git folder) to the 'extra182' repository folder inside of my GitHub folder.

5. Then, I modified the 'config.yml' and the 'index.md' files. These files are what we need to modify in order to edit the website - we don't need to edit the HTML or CSS files because by using Markdown (a light-weight markup language with plain text formatting syntax) in these two files, the corresponding HTML and CSS files will be automatically generated.

6. Then, I ran 'bundle exec jekyll serve' command but it still produced an error, which said that we needed to 'bundle install'. But this time, the 'bundle install' command worked, as shown below:

7. Afterwards, the 'bundle exec jekyll serve' command worked.

8. Since this command now works, I can now open the Jekyll site on https://localhost:4000:

Also, I have git already installed in my computer (as I've said yesterday but I wanted to show the screenshot here this time) and I already know how to use git commands, such as clone, push, and pull on git bash.

```
git clone
```

```
git push
```

```
git pull
```
